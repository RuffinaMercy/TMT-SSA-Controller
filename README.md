# TMT SSA Controller

## About the Project
**TMT SSA Controller** is a front-end software application developed for the **Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT)** Segmented Mirror Support Assembly (SSA) Controller. The software provides a user-friendly GUI to monitor and control the positioning of the telescope's 492 mirror segments in real time.

## Features
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) designed using wxFormBuilder
- Real-time data visualization of motor and actuator movements
- Integration of CSV and Excel data for seamless data handling
- Event handling for user interactions and control adjustments
- Dynamic graph updates with synchronized data processing
- Error handling and debugging for enhanced reliability

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for back-end development
- **wxFormBuilder** for GUI design
- **PyCharm** as the development environment
- **pandas** for CSV and Excel data manipulation
- **matplotlib** for graph visualization


   
## Implementation Details

### 1. GUI Development
- Used **wxFormBuilder** to design the UI.
- Integrated event handling to process user interactions, such as button clicks and data updates.
- Implemented a grid component to display CSV and Excel data for better visualization and ease of data interaction.

### 2. Data Processing
- Converted CSV data to Excel format for compatibility and streamlined processing.
- Integrated **pandas** to handle large datasets efficiently, ensuring smooth data manipulation, sorting, and retrieval.
- Ensured real-time data updates by implementing event-driven updates for dynamic display.

### 3. Data Visualization
- Used **matplotlib** for real-time graph generation and visualization.
- Integrated timers for periodic graph updates to reflect live data, ensuring a smooth and accurate visual representation of actuator and motor movements.

## Challenges Faced & Solutions
- **Component Familiarization**: Learned **wxFormBuilder** and Python event handling through trial and error, adjusting the UI to meet project requirements.
- **Event Handling Issues**: Encountered difficulties with event-driven updates, but debugged and refined interactions to ensure smooth control.
- **Data Synchronization**: Overcame synchronization issues by implementing timed updates and real-time data handling.
- **Graph Visualization**: Integrated **matplotlib** to handle live data plotting efficiently, ensuring that graphs remain accurate as data is updated.

## Learning Outcomes
- Gained proficiency in **Python GUI development** using **wxFormBuilder**.
- Developed hands-on experience with **data visualization** using **matplotlib**.
- Improved skills in **real-time data processing** and **debugging**.

## Future Scope
- Advanced real-time data analysis using **Machine Learning** for predictive monitoring.
- Remote access for telescope control via **mobile/web interface** for greater flexibility.
- 3D visualization of mirror segment alignments for improved spatial accuracy.
- Integration with other TMT subsystems for unified control and more advanced features.
